class Document(proto.Message):
    r"""A Firestore document.
    Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The resource name of the document, for example
            ``projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}``.
        fields (MutableMapping[str, google.cloud.firestore_v1.types.Value]):
            The document's fields.

            The map keys represent field names.

            A simple field name contains only characters ``a`` to ``z``,
            ``A`` to ``Z``, ``0`` to ``9``, or ``_``, and must not start
            with ``0`` to ``9``. For example, ``foo_bar_17``.

            Field names matching the regular expression ``__.*__`` are
            reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in
            certain documented contexts. The map keys, represented as
            UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty.

            Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to
            structured fields defined here. For ``map_value``, the field
            path is represented by the simple or quoted field names of
            the containing fields, delimited by ``.``. For example, the
            structured field
            ``"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}``
            would be represented by the field path ``foo.x&y``.

            Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends
            with :literal:`\`` and may contain any character. Some
            characters, including :literal:`\``, must be escaped using a
            ``\``. For example, :literal:`\`x&y\`` represents ``x&y``
            and :literal:`\`bak\`tik\`` represents :literal:`bak`tik`.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time at which the document was created.

            This value increases monotonically when a document is
            deleted then recreated. It can also be compared to values
            from other documents and the ``read_time`` of a query.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time at which the document was last
            changed.

            This value is initially set to the ``create_time`` then
            increases monotonically with each change to the document. It
            can also be compared to values from other documents and the
            ``read_time`` of a query.

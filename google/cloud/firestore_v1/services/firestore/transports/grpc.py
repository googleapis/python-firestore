    """gRPC backend transport for Firestore.

    The Cloud Firestore service.
    Cloud Firestore is a fast, fully managed, serverless,
    cloud-native NoSQL document database that simplifies storing,
    syncing, and querying data for your mobile, web, and IoT apps at
    global scale. Its client libraries provide live synchronization
    and offline support, while its security features and
    integrations with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    accelerate building truly serverless apps.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

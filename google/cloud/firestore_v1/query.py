"""Classes for representing queries for the Google Cloud Firestore API.

A :class:`~google.cloud.firestore_v1.query.Query` can be created directly from
a :class:`~google.cloud.firestore_v1.collection.Collection` and that can be
a more common way to create a query than direct usage of the constructor.

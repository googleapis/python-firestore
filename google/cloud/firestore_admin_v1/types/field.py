class Field(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents a single field in the database.
    Fields are grouped by their "Collection Group", which represent
    all collections in the database with the same id.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. A field name of the form
            ``projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}/fields/{field_path}``

            A field path may be a simple field name, e.g. ``address`` or
            a path to fields within map_value , e.g. ``address.city``,
            or a special field path. The only valid special field is
            ``*``, which represents any field.

            Field paths may be quoted using
            ``(backtick). The only character that needs to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include:``\ \*\ ``,``.\ :literal:`, ``` (backtick),`\ [``,``]`,
            as well as any ascii symbolic characters.

            Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown
            syntax, so there is an additional layer of backticks to
            represent a code block)
            ``\``\ address.city\`\ ``represents a field named``\ address.city\ ``, not the map key``\ city\ ``in the field``\ address\ ``.``\ \`\ *\`\ ``represents a field named``*\ \`,
            not any field.

            A special ``Field`` contains the default indexing settings
            for all fields. This field's resource name is:
            ``projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*``

            fields which do not have their own ``Field`` index
            configuration.
        index_config (google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Field.IndexConfig):
            The index configuration for this field. If unset, field
            indexing will revert to the configuration defined by the
            ``ancestor_field``. To explicitly remove all indexes for
            this field, specify an index config with an empty list of
            indexes.

                is set from the configuration specified by the
                ``ancestor_field``. When false, the ``Field``'s index
                configuration is defined explicitly.
            ancestor_field (str):
                Output only. Specifies the resource name of the ``Field``
                from which this field's index configuration is set (when
                ``uses_ancestor_config`` is true), or from which it *would*
                be set if this field had no index configuration (when
                ``uses_ancestor_config`` is false).
            reverting (bool):
                Output only When true, the ``Field``'s index configuration
                is in the process of being reverted. Once complete, the
                index config will transition to the same state as the field
                specified by ``ancestor_field``, at which point
                ``uses_ancestor_config`` will be ``true`` and ``reverting``

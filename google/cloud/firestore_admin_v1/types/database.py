class Database(proto.Message):
    r"""A Cloud Firestore Database. Currently only one database is allowed
    per cloud project; this database must have a ``database_id`` of
    '(default)'.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The resource name of the Database. Format:
            ``projects/{project}/databases/{database}``
        location_id (str):
            The location of the database. Available
            locations are listed at
            https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/locations.
        type_ (google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Database.DatabaseType):
            The type of the database.
            See
            https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore
            for information about how to choose.
        concurrency_mode (google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Database.ConcurrencyMode):
            The concurrency control mode to use for this
            database.
        version_retention_period (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Output only. The period during which past versions of data
            are retained in the database.

            Any [read][google.firestore.v1.GetDocumentRequest.read_time]
            or
            [query][google.firestore.v1.ListDocumentsRequest.read_time]
            can specify a ``read_time`` within this window, and will
            read the state of the database at that time.

            If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7
            days. Otherwise, the retention period is 1 hour.
        earliest_version_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The earliest timestamp at which older versions
            of the data can be read from the database. See
            [version_retention_period] above; this field is populated
            with ``now - version_retention_period``.

            This value is continuously updated, and becomes stale the
            moment it is queried. If you are using this value to recover
            data, make sure to account for the time from the moment when
            the value is queried to the moment when you initiate the
            recovery.
        point_in_time_recovery_enablement (google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Database.PointInTimeRecoveryEnablement):
            Whether to enable the PITR feature on this
            database.
        app_engine_integration_mode (google.cloud.firestore_admin_v1.types.Database.AppEngineIntegrationMode):
            The App Engine integration mode to use for
            this database.
        key_prefix (str):
            Output only. The key_prefix for this database. This
            key_prefix is used, in combination with the project id ("~")
            to construct the application id that is returned from the
            Cloud Datastore APIs in Google App Engine first generation
            runtimes.

            This value may be empty in which case the appid to use for
            URL-encoded keys is the project_id (eg: foo instead of
            v~foo).
        etag (str):
            This checksum is computed by the server based
            on the value of other fields, and may be sent on
            update and delete requests to ensure the client
            has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
